# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
BIG data, Jupyter Notebook
# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to find out if there is any review bias on a customers participation in the Amazon Vine Program. I chose to look at the Shoes category. I wanted to find out if the customers were more likey to give a 5 star review if they were a participant in the program or they actually liked the shoes

# Results: 

Based on the vine reviews of the shoes, the paid and the upaind reviews seem to have the same percentage.
The Vine reviews, non-Vine reviews, Vine review(5 stars), non Vine-review(5 stars), percentages of vine and non-vine review stars are below:

# Summary: 
With the numbers shown above, I do not think there was no significant bias in the reviews that were presented in the shoe category. The percentage of 5 star review is 59% and the one for no five star review is 53.6%. There is not significant difference. The participants must have liked the shoes. One thing we could have looked at is the demographic. That would have put the review in percepective
